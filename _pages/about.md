Hello! I am a remote sensing researcher passionate about pioneering new algorithms to estimate various surface parameters over complex terrains, such as surface reflectance, surface albedo, shortwave radiation. As mountains face rapid climate change, remote sensing offers unparalleled long-term, large-scale monitoring capabilities, and I'm excited about how my work empowers critical studies in environmental science and beyond.

Currently, I am a Post-doctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Geography at the University of Hong Kong, working with Prof. [Shunlin Liang](https://geog.hku.hk/sl-liang). You can access our Lab Page [here](https://jcqrs.hku.hk/). 

I got my PhD from Wuhan University in 2024, with insightful guidance of Prof. [Tao He](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/hetao1/zh_CN/) and Dr. [Tim McVicar](https://people.csiro.au/M/T/Tim-Mcvicar). During my undergraduate journey at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Binbin He](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/hebinbin/zh_CN/index.htm) and Prof. [Minfeng Xing](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/xingminfeng/zh_CN/index.htm).

Education
------
**·** 2019-2024 PhD in Remote Sensing Science and Technology, Wuhan University (WHU), China  
**·** 2023-2024 Visiting PhD student, CSIRO Environment, Australia  
**·** 2015-2019 BEng in Spatial Information and Digital Technology, UESTC, China

Research Interest
------
**·** **Investigating Topography's Impact on Satellite Data**: With most satellite algorithms ignoring topographic effects like shadowing, evaluating the reliability of multiple satellite-estimated surface parameters across varied spatial and temporal scales.

**·** **Pioneering Algorithms for Surface Parameter Estimation in Rugged Terrains**: Develop both robustness and effecient methods that fully incorporate topographic effects, enabling the generation of long-term and large-scale datasets for mountainous areas.

**·** **Updating scientific knowledge about mountains**: With advanced, topography-integrated satellite products, exploring new insights into comprehension of energy budgets and ecosystems in mountain areas.
